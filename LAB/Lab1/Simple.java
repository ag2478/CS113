// 1) "simple" does not cause any errors; however, it is bad practice to use a lowercase letter as the first letter of a class name. It is better to use an uppercase letter as the first letter of a class name.
// 2) "SimpleProgram" does not cause any errors and is a proper class name.
// 3) "1 Simple" causes an error because the class name cannot start with a number.
// 4) "_Simple_" does not cause any errors; however, it is better to use an uppercase letter as the first letter of a class name.
// 5) "*Simple*" causes an error because the class name cannot contain special characters.
// 6) "$123_45" does not cause any errors; however, it is a terrible class name because it is not descriptive at all.
// 7) "Simple!" causes an error because the class name cannot contain special characters.
