// Name: Mauricio Rivera
// Purpose: To print out the numbers one through five in three different languages

// 2) The program is easier to read and understand the code with the blank lines because it separates the different sections of the program.

// 3) I get an "illegal start of expression" error when I remove the first blank line from the program.

// 4) Having a comment within a comment is not a problem. The program will still run without any errors.

// 5) I have not violated any style guidelines in the program. However, the two most common ones I would violate are the brace on a new block line and the indentation of four spaces.

public class Count
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Print out the numbers one through five in English
        System.out.println("one two three four five");

        // Print out the numbers one through five in French
        System.out.println("un deux trois quatre cinq");

        // Print out the numbers one through five in Spanish
        System.out.println("uno dos tres cuatro cinco");
    }
}
