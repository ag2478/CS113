Using the Coin Class
The Coin class from Listing 4.2 in the text is in the file Coin.java. Copy it to your directory, then write a program to find the
length of the longest run of heads in 100 flips of the coin. A skeleton of the program is in the file Runs.java. To use the Coin
class you need to do the following in the program:
1. Create a coin object.
2. Inside the loop, you should use the flip method to flip the coin, the toString method (used implicitly) to print the results
of the flip, and the getFace method to see if the result was HEADS. Keeping track of the current run length (the number
of times in a row that the coin was HEADS) and the maximum run length is an exercise in loop techniques!
3. Print the result after the loop.
